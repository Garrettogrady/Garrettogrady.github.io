# Mission of Mary Farms
What started as a final project for an Internet of Things class, turned in to a proposal for implementing an environmental sensor network. After an investment from the Hanley Sustainability Institute, a team consisting of myself a 3 other Computer Science students, were able to begin implementing an environmental sensor network for the Mission of Mary Urban Farm. 

Along with the sensor network came an app I built in swift to pull the JSON from the server and parse it to display the current air and soil temperatures inside the greenhouses
