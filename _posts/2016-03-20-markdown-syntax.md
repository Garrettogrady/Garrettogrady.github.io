# Summer at Trading Technologies

![Trading tech Interns](/assets/img/tradingtech_interns.png)

Is it really almost September already? It feels like school just got out for the summer but I am already back.. This summer was one of my busiest. It started with a 2 week shadowing of a venture capitalist where I got to sit in on board meetings and help do due-dillegence on companies. After that I had a brief 2 weeks before the big move to Chicago where I would spend my summer interning at Trading Technologies. 

When I first started, I did not even know what a Future or an Option contract was. I had heard of the CME, but knew nothing about it. One could say I went in to this pretty blind. I had done research on the company before interviewing and before I accepted the job, but clearly not enough. The first day seemed like I was back in class, we had the classic orientation followed by ice breaker games where we were all awkwardly trying to remember each others names. It was finally lunch time and we we walked down the street to Giordanos - the classic must have if you’re in Chicago. The office was unlike anything I had ever seen before. I had always heard that it was the norm to have snacks and drinks, but TT went above and beyond. They had bagels every morning, 8 beers on tap, iced-brew coffee, any snack you would want and muffins on Fridays! By day two we were set up at our desks learning the code base. I had asked my manager a couple weeks in advanced if there was anything I could do to prepare for the internship, such as learn any new languages and frameworks, so I had been busy with Backbone.js and Underscore.js. I had another day of practice along with setting my environment up. I was a little disappointed they had run out of laptops to give to the interns, but I mean who has 15 extra laptops lying around, so they gave us desktops. Instead I decided to use my, what feels like a dinosaur, Macbook 2009 model. This would come back to bite me in the butt, but more on that later. I downloaded the repo and began going through issues. Fortunately I already had experience with issue tracking in Jira so I was able to hit the ground running. I started with small CSS changes and text changes and then moved up to bigger bugs and adding features. I was so amazed with how fast I was picking up. The application was huge and after playing around in the ‘Simulation Environment’ I felt like another trader! 

The team was very unique, it made up of 4 developers, 1 manager, 1 project manager, 2 product managers, 2 testers and 3 interns including myself. Unfortunately we were not able to sit on the same floor as them which caused a lot of problem when we needed help, but it was nice to get up and walk up to them. It also helped us as the interns work problems out more before going to ask for help.

About mid-summer I picked up an issue that I thought was going to be a small library change. It turned out to be a complete colorpicker plugin swap, which does not seem that bad. However what I and the product managers did not realize was how much custom code was written on top of the old colorpicker. It was a hard issue that required a lot of work and determination. At times I felt like I was working on a valueless feature. It was at that time that the classic intern ‘Imposture Syndrome’ was kicking in. I was not feeling as hot about the internship as I had thought. Then I picked up a big issue that was sitting in the backlog for a while that no one wanted to take on. So I assigned myself and got to work. It turns out the issue was something important that customers had been asking for, for a while. It was great because I got to work with the backend team and I got to pair with my manager a lot. It was a challenging issue and it helped me learn a lot about myself. I learned that I am someone who is motivated by working on issues of value to the application and company. I was much more motivated to work on the issue that customers were waiting for. It made me feel needed!

The summer turned out to be one I will never forget. I learned more than I ever thought I would in one summer and got to work alongside some of the smartest people I’ve met. I formed relationships with a lot of employees there by simply hanging out in the kitchen after work talking to them over a beer. One of my favorite things about TT was how approachable everyone was. Most companies of 500 people, it would be impossible to ‘cold-email’ the CEO and ask if he wants to go to lunch. I took a shot and we got lunch together and it was amazing! I did the same with the CTO and that was just as beneficial. Getting to here them talk about their experiences and their journeys were very beneficial. I can only hope that this next summer will be just as good as the past one!
